This directory includes data for the outline of the City of
Seattle. The data are available at:
https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Shorelines/gf6u-sgut.

The original/ directory contains the original data downloaded from
http://data.seattle.gov.

The modified/ directory contains a simplified version of
original/Shorelines/WGS84/Shorelines.shp. The original Shapefile was
modified using qgis (http://qgis.org). Two modifications were made:

  1) All features were removed except features 2 and 107 (the
     extraction expression used was "OBJECTID = 2 OR OBJECTID =
     107"). Features 2 and 107 represent "mainland" Seattle and West
     Seattle, respectively.

  2) The geometry was simplified using a "Simplify tolerance" of
     0.001. This leads to the number of vertices to go from 40,795 to
     752, making it easier to render the map on a webpage, while still
     preserving enough fidelity.

The simplified versions are available as both a Shapefile and a
GeoJSON file.
