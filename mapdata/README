This directory includes data for the outline of the City of
Seattle. The data are available at:
https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Shorelines/gf6u-sgut.

The original/ directory contains the original data downloaded from
http://data.seattle.gov.

The modified/ directory contains a simplified version of
original/Shorelines/WGS84/Shorelines.shp. The original Shapefile was
modified using qgis (http://qgis.org). The following modifications
were made:

  1) All features were removed except features 2, 107, 108, and
     120. These features represent the most important parts of Seattle
     like "mainland" Seattle and West Seattle.

  2) The geometry was simplified using a "Simplify tolerance" of
     0.001. This led to the number of vertices to go from 40,795 to
     771.

  3) To further simplify the geometry, most rings inside the features
     were removed. The only exception is Green Lake which is located
     in feature 2.

  4) Some of the vertices that added too much detail were also
     removed. Examples include a vertex that represented the location
     where Thornton Creek meets Lake Washington.

In the end, the simplifications have led to the number of vertices to
go from 40,000+ to a little over 300. Since the intent is to draw this
map in an HTML canvas, it's important to minimize the number of
vertices while still maintaining the shape of Seattle as much as
possible.
